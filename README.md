# NovoRank: Machine Learning-Based Post-Processing Tool for *De Novo* Peptide Sequencing

NovoRank is a post-processing tool designed to improve the accuracy of *de novo* peptide sequencing in proteomics. Unlike database-dependent methods, *de novo* sequencing derives peptide sequences directly from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, enabling the discovery of novel peptides. However, reliance on incomplete scoring functions often leads to incorrect identifications. NovoRank addresses this by re-ranking candidate peptides to recover correct identifications, enhancing both precision and recall. It is compatible with any *de novo* sequencing software, and by reassigning the optimal peptide, NovoRank offers a robust solution for overcoming the noise and ambiguities inherent in MS/MS data.

For detailed insights behind NovoRank, refer to the [**NovoRank paper**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00300).

## Datasets
All datasets used in this work are available for download from [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/records/14046459).  

To use NovoRank, a user MUST refer to the `README.md` in the [./data](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/tree/main/data) directory, where sample data has also been provided.

## Configuration
  
  The [config.yaml](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/blob/main/config.yaml) is used to set up the parameters and initial configurations required to run NovoRank. It contains default values, and descriptions for each option are provided as comments within it.

## Requirements
⦁ To install the required Python packages:
1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Create and activate an Anaconda virtual environment:
```c
conda create -n [NAME] python==3.9
conda activate [NAME]
```
3. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```c
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **Note:**  
> NovoRank was implemented using **Python 3.9** and utilizes the [**DeepLC**](https://github.com/compomics/DeepLC) package, which is included in the `requirements.txt`.
<br>

⦁ Software
- [**MS-Cluster**](http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software-tools/ms-clusterarchives) ([Download](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/tree/main/software/MSCluster))
- [**CometX**](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/tree/main/software/CometX) (In-house software modified to calculate XCorr, based on Comet software)

## How to Use
For the description of the datasets required to execute Steps 2 and 4, refer to [Essential Data for Using NovoRank](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/blob/main/data/README.md#essential-data-for-using-novorank).  

- Step 1. Spectral clustering using MS-Cluster
```c
MSCluster.exe --list [PATH] --output-name CLUSTERS --mixture-prob 0.01 --fragment-tolerance 0.02 --assign-charges
```
> **Note:**  
> For detailed instructions on using MS-cluster, refer to the [manual](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/blob/main/software/MSCluster/manual.pdf).
<br>

- Step 2. Generate two candidates and extract features

The parameter that controls the training process or the inference process is specified in the [config.yaml](https://github.com/jangho721/NovoRank/blob/main/config.yaml).  
```c
python generate_candidates_and_extract_features.py --search_ppm [PRECURSOR_TOLERANCE] --elution_time [ELUTION_TIME_MIN]
```
> **Note:**  
> To check the available options and their descriptions, run the command `python generate_candidates_and_extract_features.py -h`.
<br>

- Step 3. Xcorr calculation using CometX  
```c
CometX.exe -X -Pcomet.params [PATH]\*.mgf
```
> **Note:**  
> [PATH] is the directory containing MGF files for xcorr calculation.  
> `*_xcorr.tsv` files will be generated.
<br>

- Step 4. Training & Inference of the NovoRank  
```c
python run_novorank.py
```
> **Note:**  
> To check the available options and their descriptions, run the command `python run_novorank.py -h`.
<br>

1. **Training**  
To use NovoRank, users **must train a model tailored to their dataset** - it is **recommended** to use a customized model based on the *de novo* search software used.
The trained model is saved in the `./models/` directory in `.h5` format. Additionally, checkpoint models trained at each epoch can be saved.
<br>

2. **Inference**  
Inference can be performed using the pre-trained model. The pre-trained models for testing, created using three types of *de novo* search software (Casanovo, PEAKS, pNovo3), are located in the `./pretrained/` directory.
<br>
The deep learning model only handles peptides with a maximum mass of 5000 Da and a length of 40 or less.

## Results
<pre>
- The results_top1.csv file is generated at the ./data/interim location.
  (The save location and result file name can be changed in the config.yaml file)
- The NovoRank results are to output a single assigned peptide for each spectrum.
