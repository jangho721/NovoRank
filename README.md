# NovoRank: Refinement for De Novo Peptide Sequencing Based on Spectral Clustering and Deep Learning

NovoRank is a post-processing tool designed to improve the accuracy of de novo peptide sequencing in proteomics. Unlike database-dependent methods, de novo sequencing derives peptide sequences directly from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, enabling the discovery of novel peptides. However, reliance on incomplete scoring functions often leads to incorrect identifications. NovoRank addresses this by re-ranking candidate peptides to recover correct identifications, enhancing both precision and recall. By reassigning the optimal peptide from diverse de novo sequencing results, NovoRank offers a robust solution for overcoming the noise and ambiguities inherent in MS/MS data.

For detailed insights behind NovoRank, refer to the NovoRank paper.
