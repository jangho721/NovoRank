## Essential Data for Using NovoRank
- Training & Inference:  
Both `de novo search` and `MS-clust` results are required.

- For Training:  
In addition to the de novo search and MS-clust results, the `database search` result with reliable PSMs is also required for positive and negative labeling.

## Dataset Preparation
To use NovoRank, a user MUST ensure that their datasets conform to the NovoRank input standard.  
<br>

#### ⦁ De novo search result  
Once you perform de novo search, you MUST convert the result to below form:

Source File|Scan number|Peptide|Score
---|---|---|---|
Hela_1.mgf|10|HKPSVK|85|

> **Note:**  
> Each column is separated by comma (comma-separated value format (CSV)).
<br>

#### ⦁ Database search result 
Once you perform database search using the same MS/MS spectra used in the de novo search, you MUST convert the result to the below form:

Source File|Scan number|GT
---|---|---|
Hela_1.mgf|3|KPVGAAK| 

> **Note:**  
> Each column is separated by comma (comma-separated value format (CSV)).
<br>

#### ⦁ Post-translational modification notation
NovoRank assumes the following modifications:
- **Fixed modification**: All Cysteines (C) have Carbamidomethylation.
- **Variable modification**: Oxidation on Methionine (M), represented as a lowercase "m".

> **For example**:  
> If the sequence is AM+15.99EENGR, a user must convert it to AmEENGR.
